Time series forecasting of S&amp;P 500 index prices using ARIMA in R with stationarity checks, residual diagnostics, and actionable financial insights.

# 📈 Financial Market Forecasting Using ARIMA Model in R

## 📌 Business Problem
Financial institutions and investors rely on accurate forecasting to **manage risks, optimize portfolio strategies, and identify market opportunities**.  
Traditional forecasting methods often fail to capture the complex **seasonality, autocorrelation, and volatility patterns** present in financial time series data.  

This project addresses this challenge by applying **ARIMA modeling** to forecast the **S&P 500 index prices**, providing data-driven insights for investment decisions.

## ✅ Solution Overview
We developed a **time series forecasting solution** using **R programming and ARIMA modeling** to predict future price movements of the **S&P 500 index**.  

### Key Steps:
✔ **Data Collection & Preprocessing** using `quantmod`  
✔ **Log Transformation** for variance stabilization  
✔ **Stationarity & Seasonality Analysis** with ADF and Ljung-Box tests  
✔ **ACF/PACF Analysis** to identify AR and MA terms  
✔ **Model Selection** based on AIC/BIC metrics  
✔ **Residual Diagnostics** to validate model assumptions  
✔ **Forecasting** with confidence intervals

## 🔍 Detailed Analysis Steps

### **1. Data Collection**
- Downloaded historical **S&P 500 index prices** using `quantmod`.

### **2. Data Transformation**
- Converted close prices into **log returns** to achieve stationarity.

### **3. Stationarity & Seasonality Tests**
- Applied **ADF test** (p-value < 0.05 → stationary series).
- Performed **Ljung-Box test** (confirmed autocorrelation).

### **4. ACF & PACF Analysis**
- Analyzed lag structures to determine **AR and MA components**.

### **5. ARIMA Model Fitting**
- Selected **ARIMA(4,1,4)** as the best model based on AIC/BIC.
- Model equation:
SP500t = μ - 0.14(SP500t−1) + 0.82(SP500t−2) - 0.27(SP500t−3) - 0.80(SP500t−4)
+ 0.05Ut−1 - 0.77Ut−2 + 0.31Ut−3 + 0.70Ut−4

### **6. Residual Diagnostics**
- Residuals are **white noise**, confirming a good fit.

### **7. Forecasting**
- Generated **future price forecasts** with 95% confidence intervals.
